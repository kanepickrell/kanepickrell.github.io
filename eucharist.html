        <h2>About This Essay</h2>
        <p>Before diving into sections defending my premise I'd like to quickly address why I think all of my evangelical or agnostic friends should ask themselves why a symbolic perspective on the communion is insufficient as a practicing Christian. For one, my personal experience with taking this question more seriously has been an emotional and powerful journey contemplating the facts of the early church and viewing the Gospels with the lens of a Jewish audience at that time. After considering all these things, I am convinced that you cannot recieive the fullness of Christ without a belief in his transforming presence of the elements at the alter. Not only has this been an academic revelation for me, but I have experienced it too at Adoration. In His eucharistic presence during Adoration, I was praying after mass and for the first time began to feel a sense of warmth overwhelm my body. I don't know if that is going to be an isolated incident but it put in me this deeper desire to be near Him in a more intimate way. I should note as well I have not even been confirmed yet, so I have never even received a Catholic communion before this moment, but I think it is an indication that this is more than a symbol at least in my experience. 

        <br><br>In addition, I present all this not to try to win a debate, but because this question deserves our serious engagement. The stakes, according to Jesus himself in John 6:53, are high: "Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you"

        Many protestants I know live Jesus deeply and take scripture seriously (sometimes more than many Catholics I know). That being said, I simply ask: <br><br>(1) Read John 6 again <br>(2) Read 1 Corinthians 11:27-29 in light of how we should approach the Eucharistic elements <br>(3) Read what early church fathers said about the real presence (Ignatius of Antioch, Justin the Martyr, Irenaeus).

        <br><br>Then ask yourself: Am I reading the text for what it says? Or in the context of what I have been taught for years. 

        <br><br>Put yourself in the shoes of a first century Jew on a hillside listening to one of Jesus's sermon. In the following sections I will take you through the passages and scriptures that started this journey for me. I hope this not only opens your eyes to a new perspective but emboldens your faith and what it means to be of one body in Christ our Lord and Savior.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>A logical synthesis. My claim can be easily understood and digested in eight key defenses:</p>
        <p><strong>Jesus transformed physical substances</strong>— Before diving into the meat of this argument, let's start
        with an event all Christians can agree on which is Jesus's first miracle at the wedding in Cana. For those who are not
        familiar, this is the first miracle Jesus performs in his ministry by changing water into wine so that the master of the 
        feast would not be put to sharme. I'd suggest you take a look before continuing, you can find this passage in John 2:1-11.
