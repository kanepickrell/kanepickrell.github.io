        <h2>About This Essay</h2>
        <p>Before diving into sections defending my premise I'd like to quickly address why I think all of my evangelical or agnostic friends should ask themselves why a symbolic perspective on the communion is insufficient as a practicing Christian. For one, my personal experience with taking this question more seriously has been an emotional and powerful journey contemplating the facts of the early church and viewing the Gospels with the lens of a Jewish audience at that time. After considering all these things, I am convinced that you cannot recieive the fullness of Christ without a belief in his transforming presence of the elements at the alter. Not only has this been an academic revelation for me, but I have experienced it too at Adoration. For those not familiar with Adoration, it is a devotional practice of worshiping Jesus Christ truly present in the Eucharist (the consecrated Host), allowing individuals an intimate time to pray, read scripture, or simply "be" with God, fostering a deeper connection with Christ's real presence. One night after mass, I was feeling depressed and was pretty emotional thinking of my late wife, Brenna so I went to chapel and just wanted to rest a bit near Jesus. After a few minutes of leaning on the side of pew and reflecting, I felt for the first time this overwhelming sense of warmth take over my body. Jesus wants to be near His children, and while this experience may isolated incident I think God was telling me that he sees my desire to be near Him in a more intimate way. I should note as well I have not even been confirmed yet, so I have never even received a Catholic communion before this moment. God reveals Himself in many forms and when we consume His body we become part of His body. His warm embrace erased my tension that night and lightend the burden losing my best friend. He reminded me that He is near always and that He left us a part of Himself so that we may desire our greatest rest in Him.

        <br><br>In addition, I present all this not to try to win a debate, but because this question deserves our serious engagement. The stakes, according to Jesus himself in John 6:53, are high: "Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you"

        Many protestants I know live Jesus deeply and take scripture seriously (sometimes more than many Catholics I know). That being said, I simply ask: <br><br>(1) Read John 6 again <br>(2) Read 1 Corinthians 11:27-29 in light of how we should approach the Eucharistic elements <br>(3) Read what early church fathers said about the real presence (Ignatius of Antioch, Justin the Martyr, Irenaeus).

        <br><br>Then ask yourself: Am I reading the text for what it says? Or in the context of what I have been taught for years. 

        <br><br>Put yourself in the shoes of a first century Jew on a hillside listening to one of Jesus's sermon. In the following sections I will take you through the passages and scriptures that started this journey for me. I hope this not only opens your eyes to a new perspective but emboldens your faith and what it means to be of one body in Christ our Lord and Savior.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>A logical synthesis. My claim can be easily understood and digested in eight key defenses:</p>

        <p><strong>Jesus transformed physical substances</strong>— Before diving into the specific debate about the Eucharist, we need to establish something foundational: Jesus's words have creative power over physical reality.
        
        <br><br>Consider His first miracle at the wedding in Cana (John 2:1-11). When the wine runs out, Jesus doesn't simply multiply existing wine or point to a hidden reserve. He commands servants to fill jars with water, and somewhere between the jars and the steward's lips, the substance changes. The steward tastes it and declares it better wine than what was served first.
        
        <br><br>This is crucial: everyone at that wedding experienced the transformed substance without witnessing the moment of transformation. The servants knew it had been water. The steward knew it was now wine. No one saw the precise instant it changed—they simply trusted that Jesus's word had made it so.
        
        <br><br>Notice what John emphasizes: this miracle "revealed his glory" (v.11). But what glory? The glory of a party-saver? No—the glory of the Word through whom "all things were made" (John 1:3). The same creative voice that spoke light into existence at creation now speaks new reality into matter at Cana.
        
        <br><br>This establishes a pattern we see throughout Jesus's ministry: His words don't merely describe reality—they create it. He says "<strong>Be clean</strong>" and leprosy vanishes (Mark 1:41). He says "<strong>Lazarus, come out</strong>" and death reverses (John 11:43). He says "<strong>Your sins are forgiven</strong>" and the paralytic walks (Mark 2:5-11). In each case, His word accomplishes what it declares.
        
        <br><br>So when we approach the Last Supper and hear Jesus say "<strong>This is</strong> my body... <strong>this is</strong> my blood," we face a interpretive choice: Do we treat these words differently than every other performative utterance Jesus made? Do we suddenly switch from Jesus's words creating reality to Jesus's words merely describing metaphors?
        
        <br><br>The question isn't whether Jesus could transform bread and wine into His body and blood. Cana—and the entire Gospel witness—settles that question. The question is whether He did. And to answer that, we need to listen carefully to what He actually said and how His first-century Jewish audience would have heard Him.
        
        <br><br>But first, we need to understand why this matters so much... 
        
        <br></p>

        <p><strong>Jesus identifies Himself with miraculous bread</strong>— text here</p>

        <p><strong>Jesus chooses intensely physical language about consuming His flesh</strong>— text here</p>

        <p><strong>You can't understand the Last Supper without Anemnesis</strong>— text here</p>

        <p><strong>Jesus instituted the Eucharist within an incomplete Passover meal</strong>— text here</p>

        <p><strong>Jesus completes the Passover meal on the cross</strong>— text here</p>

        <p><strong>Paul treats unworthy reception as a serious sin against Christ's actual body</strong>— text here</p>

        <p><strong>The earliest Christians all view the elements literally</strong>— 
            <br><br>Ignatius of Antioch, They abstain from the eucharist and from prayer because they do not confess that the Echarist is the flesh of our Sviour Jesus Chrsist
            <br><br>Justin Martyr, We have been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word... is the fless and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh 
            <br><br>Irenaus, He declared the cup, a part of creation, to be His own blood
            <br><br>The earlist christians closest to the apostles (one of whom was a direct student of the Apostle John) unanimously interepreted the elements literally</p>
