          <h3>Learning Covenant C2 - Intstallation Guide</h3>
          <p>
            THIS IS A DEEP DIVE: Command and Control is part of Red Teaming
            tactic according to Mitre ATT&CK framework. C2 is very helpful for
            maintaining persistent access between attacker and compromised
            machine and easy to exfiltrate data. There are lot of C2 framework
            available to use from open-source version to paid-version like
            Empire, SharpC2, SilentTrinity, Metasploit, Covenant, Cobalt
            Strike(Paid), Merlin, SharpGen and SharpShell projects to allow
            operators to execute C# one-liners on Grunt implants. This allows
            for similar functionality to that described in the SharpShell post,
            but allows the one-liners to be executed on remote implants.
            Tracking Indicators — Covenant tracks “indicators” throughout an
            operation, and summarizes them in the Indicators menu. This allows
            an operator to conduct actions that are tracked throughout an
            operation and easily summarize those actions to the blue team during
            or at the end of an assessment for deconfliction and educational
            purposes. This feature is still in it’s infancy and still has room
            for improvement. Developed in C# — Personally, I enjoy developing in
            C#, which may not be a surprise for anyone that has read my latest
            blogs or tools. Not everyone might agree that development in C# is
            ideal, but hopefully everyone agrees that it is nice to have all
            components of the framework written in the same language. I’ve found
            it very convenient to write the server, client, and implant all in
            the same language. This may not be a true “feature”, but hopefully
            it allows others to contribute to the project fairly easily.
