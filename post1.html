          <h3>Learning Covenant C2 - Setup Guide & Lessons learned</h3> 
          <p style="color: gray; font-size: larger; margin-top: -10px;">45 minute read - Published: 22 Dec, 2023</p>

          <p>
            > In this guide, I'll show you how to set up Covenant C2 and establish your first listener in under an hour.<br>
            > My lack of experience in .NET and installing dependencies offline turned out to be more time-consuming than necessary. So I aim to spare you this hassle and provide a straightforward, easy-to-follow tutorial to streamline your setup process.<br>
            > As my focus will be to show you what to look out for when installing offline, I'll also walk through setting up on a Kali machine with internet access.<br>
            > As I am still pretty novice to red teaming, I think my perspective be helpful to others who are just starting out as well.<br><br>

            > Covenant C2 is a command and control (C2) post-exploitation framework. As of mid-September 2019, Covenant is considered one of the latest and advanced frameworks in this area.
            
            <br><br>
            <em>Prerequisites:</em> Compatible with Windows 10 workstations, recent Windows Server OS, or Linux distributions supporting .NET Core. Required applications: GIT and .NET Core 2.2 SDK.<br>
            <br>
            <em>Installation Process:</em> Covenant uses a modern, cross-platform architecture and does not come with a traditional installer. Installation involves cloning the project git repository and building and running the application.<br>
            <br></br>
            <strong>Online Installation</strong><br>
            > Below are the steps illustrated in <a href="https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant/wiki/Installation-And-Startup" style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank">Covenant C2's official documentation.</a>
            
            > Starting from your Kali machine, you can clone and cd into your new Covenant package.<br>
            <pre><code>
              > git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant
              > cd Covenant/Covenant
              </code></pre>
              > Before you build your Covenant C2 project, you'll need open root and update the dotnet system global variant. If you don't you'll recieve "Couldn't find a valid ICU package installed on the system". This typically occurs in Dotnet Core projects or packaged Dotnet Core binaries running on Ubuntu due to a missing dependency for Unicode and Globalization support.
              <pre><code>
                > sudo su
                > vim ~/.zshrc
              </code></pre>

              <img src="assets\css\images\dotnet_rule.jpeg">
              

              <pre><code>
                > dotnet build
                > dotnet run
              </code></pre>


            <strong>Offline Installation</strong><br>
        
            <strong>Covenant Dashboard Basics</strong><br><br>
            > So once you verify that Covenant is running, let's talk about the dashboard. <br>
            > Covenant's dashboard is web-based interface, allowing for easy management and deployment of grunts. Grunts are the agents controlled by the Covenant framework, designed to execute tasks and payloads on compromised hosts, reporting back to the Covenant server.<br>
            > Covenant supports a scalable approach, suitable for managing a large number of compromised hosts. Its modular design allows for the addition of new features and capabilities. <br>
            > One key aspect of using C2 frameworks like Covenant is maintaining stealth and avoiding detection. Covenant includes features to evade common security defenses and blend into normal network traffic. <br>
            > As an open-source project, Covenant is regularly updated by the community. Keep in mind, if you are new to using C2 architectures, it's crucial to adhere to legal and ethical guidelines, using it only in authorized environments for security testing and research purposes.<br><br>
